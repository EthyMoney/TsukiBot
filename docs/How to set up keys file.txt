Create a file named keys.api in the common folder. Put the following structure in that file:


{
    "name": "TsukiBot",
    "etherscan": "",
    "infura": "",
    "coinbase": "",
    "apisecret": "",
    "tsukibot": "",
    "stex": "",
    "stexSecret": "",
    "token": "",
    "dbl": "no",
    "coinmarketcap1": "",
    "coinmarketcap2": "",
    "coinmarketcap3": "",
    "coinmarketcap4": "",
    "coinmarketcap5": "",
    "coinmarketcap6": "",
    "coinmarketcap7": "",
    "coinmarketcap8": "",
    "coinmarketcap9": "",
    "coinmarketcap10": "",
    "coinmarketcap11": "",
    "coinmarketcap12": "",
    "coinmarketcapfailover": "",
    "coinmarketcapfailover2": "",
    "graviexAccessKey": "",
    "graviexSecretKey": "",
    "alpha": ""
}


This is where you put your api keys and other various keys and passwords that will be plugged into the bot during initialization. Put your own keys inside the empty quotes next to each field. Leave the name and dbl feilds alone.


For reference, here's what a few of those actually are:

"tsukibot"   -> your postgresql database password
"token"      -> your bot's token from the discord dev portal
"alpha"      -> your api key for alpha vantage (stocks)
